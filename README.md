- ðŸ’» DevOps Engineer | Cloud & Linux Enthusiast

Iâ€™m passionate about automating workflows, optimizing cloud environments, and building reliable systems. With a strong focus on Linux and cloud technologies, I love using tools like Terraform, Kubernetes, and Jenkins to create scalable, efficient infrastructure.

ðŸ”§ What I Work With:

- Cloud platforms (AWS)
- Linux systems & automation (Ansible, Terraform)
- CI/CD Pipelines (Jenkins, Bamboo, GitLab CI)
- Containers & Orchestration (Docker)
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) & Monitoring

Iâ€™m always looking for ways to improve system performance, reduce downtime, and make development easier and faster.
